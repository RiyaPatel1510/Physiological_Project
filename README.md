### Introduction
<p>
Heart rate variability, often known as HRV, is a measure of activity in the autonomic nervous system. An innovative and non-contact method for determining HRV using video-based methodologies is presented in the abstract of a study titled "HRV assessment with a camera." Obtaining a reading of the heart rate variability (HRV) by attaching electrodes or sensors to the skin and doing so in some circumstances can be invasive and uncomfortable. The video-based HRV measurement, on the other hand, takes use of computer vision algorithms to analyze minute alterations in facial color or motion that are linked to heart activity. This method of measuring HRV was developed more recently. Heart rates can be non-invasively and remotely monitored using video cameras without the subject ever having to be physically touched. This technology's dramatic ascent to popularity can be directly attributed to a number of factors, including its inexpensive cost, its ease of use, and the ubiquitous availability of video cameras. This study investigates the theory behind remote heart rate monitoring via video, as well as its current use and possible applications in the future. In this section, we discuss the shortcomings of this strategy as well as potential improvements. We demonstrate the potential applications of video-based remote heart rate detection in a variety of fields, including medicine, wellness, and even entertainment. In conclusion, we will go over the development of this technology as well as its possible applications in the near and distant future. The ability to remotely monitor a person's heart rate using video has huge ramifications for the enhancement of people's health, happiness, and the pleasure they derive from consuming digital media. Our objective is to achieve a higher degree of precision, and we want to do so by implementing new systems.

# How to Run:

<p>
To execute the program, specify the input video's path in the preprocessing.read video() function on line 13 of the main.py file. To modify the frequency range to be filtered, modify the freq min and freq max values on lines 8 and 9.
